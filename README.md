  ## What is this about?
  This is a repository of all my exercises, labs, and other activities in **CSMC211** *Object-Oriented Programming*

  ## What software/application is very much needed in the world today?

In my opinion, a software/application that we really need in the world today is a tracker for COVID-19. This will help us do contact tracing and knowing whether we were exposed with the virus. This software/application for smartphones is already being developed by Apple, in partnership with google.
